subtitle: Tracks skin treatment efficacy. The administrators of the study have access to manipulate questionnaires for uses to submit through an admin interface. The user interface is accessible via mobile application that makes use of completing questionnaires and capturing target spots such as the face. These target spots are made consistent with custom image overlay feature that administrators also have access to manipulate.

    Client wanted to build out a clinical mobile application that would create consistency in result images for shown clinical efficacy. There was also an emphasis to have app-users complete questionnaires that backend-users would collect data from clinical studies on.

    To create consistency with result images, I needed to create image overlays for the app-user to line up their body part with <b>(such as a hand or face)</b>.

    #### A information architecture was created so that the developers would understand the app page progression.

    #### Finally
    A back-end needed to be created that the clinical physicians would use to collect app-user results and create new questionnaire studies for the app-users. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/99398140-35d4-4794-a12e-371df116b26a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Link to backend database prototype made with Adobe Experience Design</a>.

    Once the prototype was completed and the developers understood the scope of the build out we worked to create the mobile application. Throughout the build out I worked to perform quality assurance testing on all features and functions. This ensured that the app-user would not run into issues on launch.
    
    We soft launched the mobile application and it is currently in use for 3+ different clinical studies since its creation.
